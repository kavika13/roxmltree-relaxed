# roxmltree-relaxed

This is a fork of https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree that exposes options to support some of the relaxed parsing needs I have for some projects.

If you file a PR, make sure the default behavior is identical to that of the original roxmltree.

It also depends on https://github.com/kavika13/xmlparser-relaxed, which itself is forked from https://github.com/RazrFalcon/xmlparser.

Represents an [XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) document as a read-only tree.

```rust
// Find element by id.
let doc = roxmltree_relaxed::Document::parse("<rect id='rect1'/>")?;
let elem = doc.descendants().find(|n| n.attribute("id") == Some("rect1"))?;
assert!(elem.has_tag_name("rect"));
```

## Why read-only?

Because in some cases all you need is to retrieve some data from an XML document.
And for such cases, we can make a lot of optimizations.

As for *roxmltree*, it's fast not only because it's read-only, but also because
it uses [xmlparser], which is many times faster than [xml-rs].
See the [Performance](#performance) section for details.

## Parsing behavior

Sadly, XML can be parsed in many different ways. *roxmltree* tries to mimic the
behavior of Python's [lxml](https://lxml.de/).
But unlike *lxml*, *roxmltree* does support comments outside the root element.

For more details see [docs/parsing.md](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree/blob/master/docs/parsing.md).

Legend:

- ✓ - supported
- × - parsing error
- ~ - partial
- *nothing* - not supported

Notes:

1. No default namespace propagation.
2. *roxmltree* keeps all node and attribute positions in the original document,
   so you can easily retrieve it if you need it.
   See [examples/print_pos.rs](examples/print_pos.rs) for details.
3. In the `memchr` crate.
4. Binary size overhead according to [cargo-bloat](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat).
5. Depends on build flags.

There is also `elementtree` and `treexml` crates, but they are abandoned for a long time.

```

*roxmltree* uses [xmlparser] internally,
while *sdx-document* uses its own implementation,
*xmltree* uses the [xml-rs].
Here is a comparison between *xmlparser*, *xml-rs* and *quick-xml*:

test huge_xmlparser      ... bench:   1,744,585 ns/iter (+/- 28,509)
test huge_quick_xml      ... bench:   2,818,954 ns/iter (+/- 66,923)

### Iteration

```text

test roxmltree_iter_descendants_expensive   ... bench:     255,261 ns/iter (+/- 1,424)
test xmltree_iter_descendants_expensive     ... bench:     354,316 ns/iter (+/- 3,383)

test roxmltree_iter_descendants_inexpensive ... bench:      20,736 ns/iter (+/- 218)
test xmltree_iter_descendants_inexpensive   ... bench:     125,849 ns/iter (+/- 1,200)

test roxmltree_iter_children                ... bench:       1,409 ns/iter (+/- 54)
```

Where expensive refers to the matching done on each element. In these
benchmarks, *expensive* means searching for any node in the document which
contains a string. And *inexpensive* means searching for any element with a
particular name.

### Notes

The benchmarks were taken on a Apple M1 Pro.
You can try running the benchmarks yourself by running `cargo bench` in the `benches` dir.

- Since all libraries have a different XML support, benchmarking is a bit pointless.
- Tree crates may use different *xml-rs* crate versions.
- We bench *libxml2* using the *[rust-libxml]* wrapper crate
- *quick-xml* is faster than *xmlparser* because it's more forgiving for the input,
  while *xmlparser* is very strict and does a lot of checks, which are expensive.
  So performance difference is mainly due to validation.

## Memory Overhead

`roxmltree` tries to use as little memory as possible to allow parsing
very large (multi-GB) XML files.

The peak memory usage doesn't directly correlates with the file size
but rather with the amount of nodes and attributes a file has.
How many attributes had to be normalized (i.e. allocated).
And how many text nodes had to be preprocessed (i.e. allocated).

`roxmltree` never allocates element and attribute names, processing instructions
and comments.

By disabling the `positions` feature, you can shave by 8 bytes from each node and attribute.

On average, the overhead is around 6-8x the file size.
For example, our 1.1GB sample XML will peak at 7.6GB RAM with default features enabled
and at 6.8GB RAM when `positions` is disabled.

## Safety

- This library must not panic. Any panic should be considered a critical bug and reported.
- This library forbids `unsafe` code.

## Non-goals

- Complete XML support.
- Tree modification and writing.
- XPath/XQuery.

## API

This library uses Rust's idiomatic API based on iterators.
In case you are more familiar with browser/JS DOM APIs - you can check out
[tests/dom-api.rs](tests/dom-api.rs) to see how it can be converted into a Rust one.
